# Project: Mercenary punishment in structured populations
This is the source code of project "Mercenary punishment in structured populations".

Two type of code are written: C++(12.0.0) code and Python (3.7.7 or later) code. The results of the two experiments are identical.

I have not finished this part.

For any further problem, please send an email to colin.cleveland.formal@gmail.com. Thank you very much.
